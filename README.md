# Textile Explore

_Demonstrator/exploratory projects by the Textile team &amp; community_

Ready to dig into developing a new Textile tool or 'hack'? You can start by getting your dev environment setup following this '[Getting Started](https://github.com/textileio/textile-go/wiki/Getting-Started)' guide. If you want to develop directly on the Textile codebase (in Go), you'll probably want to [check out this guide](https://github.com/textileio/textile-go/wiki/Development-Setup) first.

Once you're all setup, you'll want to check out the [command-line interface](https://github.com/textileio/textile-go/wiki/Command-Line) for a list of tools and commands you can use to interact with Textile. This will be your starting place for figuring out how to use Textile tooling to create groups/threads, add content, edit peer configurations, etc. You might also want to check out some of the existing experiments in this repo for inspiration or ideas.

Looking to tackale a more 'subtantial' project? We have a series of funded [Request for Projects/Proposals (RFPs)](https://github.com/textileio/textile-explore/labels/RFP) issues you can check out. These are projects identified by the Textile team as 'high priority' community projects. If you are interested in taking on one of these projects, make sure you [get in touch](https://slack.textile.io/)!
